# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing road accident data using Microsoft Excel. The main objective of this analysis is to identify accident trends, understand the major causes, and uncover meaningful insights that can support road safety initiatives and traffic management strategies.
## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze and visualize road accident data using Microsoft Excel.  
It aims to:
- Identify accident patterns and yearly trends.
- Determine the major causes contributing to road accidents.
- Examine how factors like road type, area, and light conditions impact accident severity.
- Present data-driven insights that can support road safety improvements and better traffic management.
- Demonstrate the power of Excel in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization through an interactive dashboard.
## ❓ Analysis Questions

1. Which type of vehicle is involved in the highest number of accidents?
2. How many total, fatal, serious, and slight casualties occurred during the analysis period?
3. What type of road has the maximum number of accidents (single carriageway, dual carriageway, etc.)?
4. During which months do most road accidents occur?
5. How do light conditions (day vs. night) affect the number of casualties?
6. Which area type (urban or rural) experiences more road accidents?
7. What is the overall trend of road accidents over time?
8. How do different vehicle types contribute to total casualties?

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Casualties** – Overall number of accident victims.
- **Fatal Casualties** – Number of deaths caused by accidents.
- **Serious Casualties** – Number of people seriously injured.
- **Slight Casualties** – Number of people with minor injuries.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type** – Breakdown of casualties caused by cars, bikes, buses, etc.
- **Casualties by Road Type** – Distribution of accidents across single and dual carriageways.
- **Casualties by Light Condition** – Daytime vs. nighttime accident comparison.
- **Casualties by Area** – Urban vs. rural accident analysis.
- **Monthly Accident Trend** – Accident frequency across different months.

## ⚙️ Process

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gathered raw road accident dataset containing details about vehicle type, casualties, road type, lighting, and area.
   - Imported the dataset into Microsoft Excel for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicate and irrelevant records.
   - Handled missing or inconsistent data values.
   - Standardized column names and formats for better readability.
   - Filtered data to include only relevant years and variables.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Organized the dataset into structured tables.
   - Created calculated columns for total, serious, and slight casualties.
   - Used Excel formulas to derive additional insights and metrics.

4. **Data Analysis**  
   - Applied filters, sorting, and conditional formatting to identify trends and patterns.
   - Used pivot tables to summarize data by vehicle type, road type, light condition, and area.
   - Calculated monthly and yearly trends to observe accident frequency.

5. **Data Visualization**  
   - Designed interactive Excel dashboards using charts, pivot charts, and slicers.
   - Visualized accident distribution across vehicle types, areas, and time periods.
   - Highlighted key metrics using data labels and conditional formatting.

6. **Insights Generation**  
   - Derived meaningful insights to understand the root causes and high-risk conditions.
   - Interpreted data trends to provide recommendations for road safety improvements.

7. **Project Documentation**  
   - Compiled findings and visuals into a professional Excel dashboard.
   - Created README documentation to present objectives, KPIs, and insights.

## 💡 Project Insights

- 🚗 **Cars** are responsible for the highest number of casualties, contributing to nearly 80% of total road accident victims.  
- 🛣️ **Single carriageways** have the most reported accidents compared to other road types.  
- 🌆 **Urban areas** record more accidents than rural areas, indicating higher traffic density and congestion.  
- ☀️ The majority of accidents occur during **daylight**, suggesting that factors like driver behavior and road conditions play a bigger role than visibility.  
- 📅 **Monthly analysis** shows noticeable peaks in certain months, indicating possible seasonal or weather-related effects.  
- ⚠️ **Serious and fatal casualties** make up a smaller percentage, but they highlight the need for better safety awareness and preventive measures.  
- 📈 The overall trend indicates a gradual change in accident frequency over time, reflecting the impact of safety initiatives and road improvements.  
- 🧠 These insights emphasize the importance of data-driven decisions to enhance **road safety policies**, improve **traffic management**, and reduce **future accident risks**.

## ✅ Final Conclusion

This Road Accident Analysis project, developed entirely using Microsoft Excel, provides valuable insights into how various factors contribute to road accidents. Through effective data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, the project highlights that cars are responsible for the majority of casualties, single carriageways experience the highest accident rates, and most incidents occur in urban areas during daylight hours.  

The findings demonstrate that accidents are not only influenced by visibility but also by road infrastructure, traffic density, and driver behavior. By identifying high-risk conditions and trends, this analysis can assist policymakers, transport authorities, and researchers in designing better road safety programs and awareness campaigns.  

Overall, the project showcases the power of Excel as a reliable tool for end-to-end data analysis and visualization. It emphasizes that even without advanced BI tools, meaningful insights can be derived from structured data to support data-driven decision-making and improve public safety outcomes.
